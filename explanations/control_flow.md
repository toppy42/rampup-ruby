# Control Flow

## What's Control Flow?
This is how computers make decisions.  We give them a flow to follow

## Glossary
| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Decision Tree | A visual representation of how to make decisions |
| Flow Chart | Similar to a Decision Tree |
| Conditional | The questions we can ask to make our decision |
| Condition | An expression that evaluates to true/false |

## Syntax rules
### Multiline Conditional
Multiline conditionals must have an `end`.  The `end` closes the conditional.    
If you forget to put `end`, you will get an error like this:

`SyntaxError: (irb):7: syntax error, unexpected tSTRING_DEND, expecting keyword_end`

Please indent your code so that if/else/end are aligned, and the internal conditions are aligned

```ruby
if my_var > 9000
  puts 'HIS POWER LEVEL IS OVER 9000!'
else
  puts 'You are weak!'
end
```


### Inline conditional
```ruby
puts 'Hi' if user_name == 'Ethan'
```

Exactly the same as:
```ruby
if user_name == 'Ethan'
  puts 'Hi'
end
```


### Ternary Conditional
Don't use this.  Just for reading purposes  
`my_var > 9000 ? puts 'HIS POWER LEVEL IS OVER 9000!' : puts 'You are weak!'`


## Types of conditionals

### if/elsif/else:
```ruby
if my_age >= 21
  puts 'You can drink'
elsif my_age >= 18
  puts 'You can smoke'
else
  puts 'You are a minor'
end
```


### unless:
Opposite of an if statement.  Only used to make code more like english  
These do the same thing

```ruby
if my_age >= 21
  puts 'You can drink'
end

unless my_age < 21
  puts 'You can drink'
end
```


### case:
When there are many elsifs in your conditional, you may prefer a case

```ruby
case my_age
when my_age >= 21
  puts 'You can drink'
when my_age >= 18
  puts 'You can smoke'
else
  puts 'You are a minor'
end
```

## Truthiness
There are only two things that the computer thinks are false: `false` and `nil`  
Everything else is considered `true`


## Common problems

### Single `=` instead of double `==`:

This will always execute because `myage = 21` returns `21` which is [truthy](#truthiness)
```ruby
if my_age = 21
  puts 'You are 21'
end
```

Make sure you are actually comparing:
```ruby
if my_age == 21
  puts 'You are 21'
end
```


### Conditions that can never be reached:
```ruby
if my_age >= 18
  puts 'You can smoke'
elsif my_age >= 21
  puts 'You can drink'  # This will never be executed
else
  puts 'You are a minor'
end
```


### Missed cases:
This code tells us that 0 is a negative number.  That doesn't sound right

```ruby
if my_number > 0
  puts 'This number is positive'
else
  puts 'This number is negative'
end
```


### Wrong conditions:
Make sure you are testing the right thing!  
This code will not allow an 18 year old to smoke or a 21 year old to drink

```ruby
if my_age > 21
  puts 'You can drink'
elsif my_age > 18
  puts 'You can smoke'
else
  puts 'You are a minor'
end
```
